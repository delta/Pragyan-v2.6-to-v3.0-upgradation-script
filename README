INSTALLATION STEPS
===================

* go to the direcroy in which the cms has been installed

{{{
$ cd /path/to/dir/
}}}

* now copy all uploaded files in your site (which is present in cms/uploads directory) outside the cms directory

{{{
$ mv cms/uploads .
}}}

* move the configurations file to outside the cms directory

{{{
$ mv cms/config.inc.php .
}}}

* if you're using a custom template (other than the default crystalx template), you might want to take a backup of your template files and start the process of making it compatible with pcmsv3.0

* now completely remove the cms and INSTALL directories

{{{
$ su
Password: 
# rm -r cms/ INSTALL/
}}}

* copy or extract the cms directory of pragyan v3.0 stable release to this directory

* open the new and old config files (config.inc.php) using a text editor and create the new config file

* copy the uploads dir to the new cms directory

{{{
# mv ./uploads ./cms
}}}

make sure you set 777 premissions to the uploads directory

* run the sql queries given in the sqlupdate.sql file in the database in which the cms was installed to upgrade your database to pcmsV3

* You might want to install a new template to your site (go to *admin* page in the site and select the templates submenu)

* You're finally done upgrading your site to the new flashy Pragyan CMS v3. :-)
