Hi!! 

The National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, proudly brings to you its International Level Techno-Management festival, Pragyan, back this time as Pragyan '10 from 25th to 28th of February 2010!

In solemn pursuit of excellence, Pragyan brings to you a spectacular combination of Workshops and Guest Lectures this time round.

Get your hands busy with Workshops like:


1) Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/workshops/adobe_flex/>:

Conducted by Adobe, participants will be shown how Adobe AIR helps develop and deploy ‘Rich Internet Applications’, and also how Adobe Flex helps you to create visually enhanced applications for your web-pages. With Flex, you can say good-bye to long, painstaking HTML coding.

2)3D Photography <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/workshops/d3_photography/>:

Ever wondered how in movies like Avatar, things seem to pop out of the screen and jump into the third dimension that we call "Space"?? Now you can create 3-D photographs using ANY camera and bring your images to life!

3)Ethical Hacking <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/workshops/ethical_hacking/>:

IT Security is the next big thing in India, according to NASSCOM, and this workshop offers a ‘Certified Information Security Expert - Level A’ certificate to every participant who completes it successfully!

4)Hexapod Robotics Workshop <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/workshops/hexapod/>:

For the first time in India, an advanced robotics workshop that features a six-legged robot. Capable of performing mind-blowing gaits, this android is definitely the best in its kind.

Prepare to be inspired with our Guest Lecture Series:

1)Dr. Peter Nordin <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/guestlectures/peter_nordin/>:

An inspiring entrepreneur and listed as one of Sweden’s Most Influential Contemporary Inventors, there’s hardly anything in the field of robotics and automation that he hasn’t had a go at! Add to the bag the fact that he’s co-founded more than a dozen companies, and you know why you want to be there to meet him, in person.

2)Dr. Ramesh Jain <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/guestlectures/ramesh_jain/>:

Hailing from the University of California, Irvine, he is the founding Editor-In-Chief of the IEEE Multimedia magazine and the founder of 3 enterprises- PRAJA Inc., Virage and ImageWare Inc.

3)Dr. P M Bhargava <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/guestlectures/pm_bhargava/>:

The man who gave us the term ‘Genetic Engineering’; a recipient of the Padma Bhushan and Legion d'Honneur, France’s highest civilian honour, he is also founding director of the UNESCO Centre of Excellence in Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad.

4)Dr.Ranjan Dash <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/guestlectures/ranjan_dash/>:

Declared a young innovator by MIT TR35, his company 'Y-Carbon' is a nanotechnology milestone, revolutionizing the world of energy storage. Simply put Dr. Dash is the true 'GOD OF SMALL THINGS'

5)Dr. Srinidhi Vardharajan <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/guestlectures/srinidhi_varadarajan/>:

The architect of System X, one of the world's fastest and least expensive supercomputers, he has been declared by MIT as one of the top 100 young innovators transforming technology today.

6)Dr. Are Holen <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/guestlectures/are_holen/>:

This Scientist-Genius who specializes in stress psychiatry, meditation and post-disaster psychology in humans, founded the non-profit ‘Acem International School of Meditation’ in 1966.

The battle of words in Crossfire <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/panel_discussion/>:

Do you feel imprisoned by the invisible walls of society? Think you have what it takes make a bold decision and back it up? Well, then present yourself for our panel discussion-I Do It On my own Terms, or I.D.I.O.T.S for short, and make YOUR mark on society.

Exhibitions <http://www.pragyan.org/10/home/exhibitions/>:

Grab a bite from our sumptuous food stalls and make your way to the exhibitions arena to witness the thrill of a lifetime! The display of Compact Destruction Vehicles by DRDO is sure to take your breath away, but only momentarily, before the Air Show by veterans of the Madras Flying Club sends your adrenaline pumping again.
