Hello there!

The grand techno-management fest of NIT, Trichy kicks off on the 28th February. Apart from the events, there's loads to do at Pragyan. Here's quick run through.

Guest Lectures:

Dr. Philippe Lebrun:
Dr. Philippe Lebrun is Head of the Accelerator Technology Department at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). The Large Hadron Collider(LHC), which is the largest scientific instrument ever made, is being funded and built in collaboration with over two thousand physicists from thirty-four countries as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories, with Dr. Lebrun at the helm.

Philip Zimmermann:
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), VoIP encryption protocols notably ZRTP and Zfone are some of the creations of Philip Zimmermann. He was one of the first to make asymmetric, or public key, encryption software readily available to the general public. He released the source code for PGP, which is now the most widely used email encryption software in the world, and made it available overseas via the Internet in 1991.

Dr. Subramanian Swamy
Dr Subramanian Swamy is a leading economist and an authority on Indo-China relations. 
He has served as a Cabinet Minister for Commerce, Law & Justice and has held the post of Chairman of the Commission on Labour Standards & International Trade. He was a member of the Planning Commission in 1990-1991, when the decisions to liberalise the Indian Economy were taken, leading to the phenomenal growth that we see today. 

Prof. Trilochan Sastry
Dr. Trilochan Sastry is a Professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. An alumnus of IIT Delhi, he did an MBA from IIM-Ahmedabad and received his doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA. He will be giving a talk on entrepreneurship.
 
Mark Shuttleworth
 Mark Shuttleworth is the creator of Ubuntu, a venture capitalist, a space tourist and a leading philanthropist in the year 2002; he gained worldwide fame when he became only the second space tourist at the time as a spaceflight participant aboard the Russian Soyuz TM-34 mission. 

Ronald Mallet
Dr. Ronald L. Mallet is a Professor of Physics at the University of Connecticut. Prof. Mallet's proclivity for the subject stemmed from an interest in science and science fiction. Now an authority on the subject of time travel, he believes he is tantalizingly close to achieving his ultimate dream, a real working time machine! 

Workshops:

Robotics Workshop
Dr. Amir Shapiro is a professor teaching at the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel. He actively conducts research in robotics and takes courses in Dynamics, Robotics and Mechatronics. For his contributions his biography has been included in the Who's Who in Engineering Academia 2007. At Pragyan '08 Dr. Amir Shapiro will conduct a workshop on bio-inspired robotics and will be bringing hos snake robot for display.

Ham Radio Workshop
Ham Radio Operators undergo a very thorough process before being certified by the government. So this is probably the closest you can get to have the intricacies of Ham Radio explained by an expert attached with ISRO Satellite Center. More than 3 million people in the world pursue HAM radio operating as a hobby! It's time for you to start too!
